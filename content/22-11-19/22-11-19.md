In this series I discuss the fears, concerns and challenges faced by organisations developing on the Microsoft Power Platform who are looking to harness automation testing. This series goes beyond the introductory how-to guides (valuable as they are) to consider obstacles preventing your organisation from upgrading to automation and, crucially, suggests measures to overcome them.
