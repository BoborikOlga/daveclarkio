Netflix even A/B test images used for film titles, drawing the gaze of their viewiers to new blockbuster films, getting that first click which ultimately results in more minutes watched for films and provides a better user experience. 

In fact Netflix say A/B testing a title image sometimes resulst in **20% to 30% more viewing for that title.** [Source](https://variety.com/2016/digital/news/netflix-ab-tests-image-optimization-trick-1201674325/).

So **what is A/B testing**? **How can Dynamics 365 and Power Platform benefit** from it? 

## Introduction

This post starts by **explaining what A/B testing is**. It then looks at **use cases and success stories from big tech firms** to help justify why we, as Power Platform consultants and developers, should care about this tool. 

We then **walkthrough an example in Dynamics 365** *already available* to us, to help **drive marketing success**.

Finally we consider other **ways A/B testing can be used in Dynamics** to **engage end users** for early user adoption and project success and ongoing **productivity increases**.

## What is A/B testing?

The concept behind A/B testing is to create a control group and one or more experimental groups and provide them different versions of a product. We can then **track metrics** against each group, such as: 

- Quantity of data filled in on a Dynamics 365 form
- Time taken to open and save a form
- Click throughs in a marketing emails

Have you ever been in a requirements meeting where **stakeholders disagree on layout for a form on an app?** With A/B testing we can **decide product changes based on data**, rather than the loudest stakeholder.

## Real-life success story

Ubisoft are a video game publisher based in Paris. You may have heard of them or some of their games including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell.

While releasing a new game, For Honor, Ubisoft created **two versions of the game's 'Buy Now' page**, and **collected data on each page's success** during the holiday season (Oct - Dec 2017).

### Before the testing phase:

<img src="for-honor-before.png" />

The hypothesis was that the **buying process could be simplified by reducing the need to scroll** on this page. As the image above shows, before the buyer would have to select their preferred game edition, scroll down, select their console, scroll down, then place their order and enter their payment details.

### After the testing phase:

<img src="for-honor-after.png" />

This new version removes the need to scroll as all buying options are selectable in a single column. Comparing test data between the two layout versions demonstrated a **12% increase in lead generation**.

## A/B testing in Dynamics 365 for marketing success

Designing the perfect marketing email can be tough. Perhaps you have a few similar ideas floating around - you might be ok deciding which to choose based on intuition or past experience. 

Or, you might **use A/B testing to find out which of a few similar designs performs the best** on a subset of your audience. Then **send the successful candidate** to the remainder of your audience. As we've seen from earlier examples, **basing design decisions on data**, rather than a hunch, could be the smart move to ensure success.

### Example walkthough in Dynamics 365 for Marketing

In this example we create two versions of a marketing email, version A and version B. We then enable the A/B test feature in Dynamics 365 for Marketing on my marketing emails. We'll see what Dynamics 365 can offer us in terms of:
- A/B test configuration options
- Performance metrics
- Test results data display

To create a marketing email you can follow <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dynamics365/marketing/email-design" target="_blank">this Microsoft guide</a>.

Here's one I prepared earlier:

<img src="option-a.png" />

With a marketing email created, we can press the **Add A/B test** button shown to the left of the subject field in the screenshot above. Select to **test against changes to the email body, the from name or the email subject**.

In my example 'Version B' changes the wording in the email body slightly:

> For full details on how to configure email templates for A/B testing in Dynamics, refer to Microsoft's documentation <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dynamics365/marketing/email-a-b-testing" target="_blank">here</a>.

Now we're ready to test our emails using a customer journey. Here Microsoft's documentation notes the following:

> To produce reliable test results, you should always send each version (A and B) to a minimum of 100 recipients before allowing the system to choose a winner. A typical recommended setup would use a 1,000-member segment (or larger), with a test distribution that sends version A to 10% of the segment, version B to another 10%, and then sends the winning design to the remaining 80%.

My journey simply has two steps: first it selects a subset of my contact base (recent event attendees) and then send them the marketing email I just created. 

<img src="customer-journey.png" />

To use the marketing email created earlier, select the marketing email message tile in the journey, then select properties on the right and select your new message in the 'Marketing email message' lookup field.

In the properties pane you'll also be able to specify A/B test distribution, **winning metric** and **test duration**:

<img src="email-options.png" />

With that configured I can click 'Go Live' in the command bar. Then I play the waiting game! Note that 1 day was specified as the test duration. During this time I can scroll down to the **data** panel test-

<img src="test-results.png" />

Once the test duration is up, there should be a clear winner: in this case **the version of the email body that received the most click-throughs**. The remaining 80% of my contact-base can then be sent the more successful version of my marketing email.

## What next for A/B testing in Dynamics 365?

At the time of writing, marketing emails in Dynamics 365 is the only module supporting A/B testing. But if you've read this far you must be thinking: **why stop there**?
